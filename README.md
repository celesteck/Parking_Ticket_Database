# Parking_Ticket_Database

This is an in-memory parking ticket database. It takes in data from actual data summons (tickets) extracted from the New York City summons database for the fiscal year 2018. 

In this project, I practice:
  1. Writing data structures in C using pointers
  2. Basic memory runtime, memory allocation, and deallocation with malloc() and free()
  3. Using the valgrind to test usage of malloc() and free()
  4. Working with hash table chains and 2-D linked lists
  5. Writing code to traverse every record in a database to find a specific entry
  6. Writing code to use a hash function to find a specific entry in the database.
